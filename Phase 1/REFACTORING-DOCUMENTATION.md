# Controller Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring process applied to the controllers in Phase 1 of the Library Management System. The main goal was to establish proper separation of concerns by ensuring controllers don't make direct database calls to models outside their domain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Loan Controller Refactoring

- Removed direct database calls to `User` and `Book` models
- Added service methods to communicate with `userController` and `bookController`
- Implemented proper error handling for the service-based communication

### 2. User Controller Refactoring

- Removed direct access to the `Loan` model
- Added service methods for other controllers to use:
  - `getUserById_service`: Retrieves a user by ID
  - `getUserCount_service`: Gets the total user count for system overview

### 3. Book Controller Refactoring

- Removed direct access to the `Loan` and `User` models
- Added service methods for other controllers to use:
  - `getBookById_service`: Retrieves a book by ID
  - `updateBookAvailability`: Service for updating book availability when issuing/returning

### 4. Added Service Methods Between Controllers

- `loanController` service methods:
  - `getActiveLoans_service`: Used by `userController` for getting active users
  - `getPopularBooks_service`: Used by `bookController` for popular books report
  - `getLoanStatistics_service`: Used by `bookController` for system overview

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each controller now manages operations only related to its own domain
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Controllers communicate through defined service interfaces
3. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across service communications
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Each service can be tested in isolation

## Testing

The refactoring has been verified with:
1. `test-controller-interactions.js`: Tests the service methods directly
2. `test-api-endpoints.js`: Tests the complete API flow to ensure refactoring didn't break functionality

## Next Steps

This refactoring lays the groundwork for moving to a microservices architecture in Phase 2, as controllers now have clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between them.
